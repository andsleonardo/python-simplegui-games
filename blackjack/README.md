# Blackjack

This is a Python 2 implementation of _Blackjack_ for a single player.

## How to play
1. Go to http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user45_TJyrBjL2Fh_1.py on your desktop and click the _Run_ button. You might have to resize and click the game frame once to make it respond to the keyboard commands.
2. To start a new round, press **Deal**. On the left, you'll see your cards and the amount of cash available to bet. On the right, there's the dealer's hand, right above the round's pot.
3. You can either **Hit** (ask for a new card), **Stand** (end your round and see what the dealer has) or **Raise** your bet.
4. Have you lost all your money? Click the **Get more cash** button to cheat the game.

## Notes
- The dealer always wins ties.
- The dealer does not bet more cash against the player.

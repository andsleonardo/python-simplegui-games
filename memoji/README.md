# Memoji
This is a Python 2 implementation of a memory game for a single player.

## How to play
1. Go to http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user45_mviRUflGNi_0.py on your desktop and click the _Run_ button. You might have to resize and click the game frame once to make it respond to the keyboard commands.
2. Click the cards in order to find all the emoji pairs in the smallest number of turns. The game keeps track of your record for a session, so you can compete with friends.

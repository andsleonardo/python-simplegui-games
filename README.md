# Python games developed with simplegui
This repository assembles some of my solutions to the assignments of Coursera's [_An introduction to interactive programming in Python_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1), ministered by Rice University. All games can be played running the source code on [Codeskulptor](https://codeskulptor.org).
